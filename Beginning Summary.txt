Dawnbreak Warden is a game taken place in a post-apocalyptic world where machines take over and magic is lost to time
the player is one of the few remaining people (4 others including final boss) that can use magic
machines and technology killed almost every human
Only a couple Dozen remain in the mere thousands
The Dawnbreak Warden is the final boss
unknown to anyone in how he looks or acts
but he controls all machines with his magic and caused this fucking machine takeover
he has a 2nd magic which is powerful (ex: it can make blackholes, that isnt all the magic it can do tho (his abilities arent finished))
The Player (You) begin in a lab where you're being experimented on by machines as they try and grab the magic from you to use it for their own gain, but you are to escape this lab and venture on a long journey across the world meeting the 4 legendary mages and assist them so you can be trained under them
