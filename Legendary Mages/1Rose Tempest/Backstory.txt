Rose Tempest — The Galeborne Ember

Before the world drowned in metal and rebellion, Rose Tempest’s life was already shaped by abandonment and instability. Her parents left her when she was too young to understand why—too young to remember their faces. She grew up in an overcrowded orphanage on the edge of a quiet valley town, where storms rolled across the mountains and wildfires were a seasonal threat.

Despite the chaos around her, the children and caretakers became her family. The place was poorly run, often cold and understaffed, but it was home. They were the only people who ever looked at her with warmth.

It was in that orphanage that her strange abilities first surfaced.
Not fire—wind.

At six years old, she could stir gusts by accident, send papers flying when she laughed, or calm a screaming infant with a gentle breeze. The caretakers noticed but hid it; magic, even before the apocalypse, drew attention no child should receive. They taught her to stay quiet, to stay small, to never reveal the air that danced around her fingers.

But sparks followed soon after.
Fleeting. Uncontrolled. Dangerous.
The pressure of the wind sometimes ignited into sudden flashes of heat. Rose feared it. The others reassured her.

“You’re special,” they whispered. “Just don’t let anyone else see.”

The Day the World Ended

When Rose was ten, the machine uprising struck her town with merciless precision. Drones tore through the skies, mechanical harvesters dragged humans into metal prisons, and entire neighborhoods burned under cold, calculated assault.

Rose was scavenging for food when it happened—just a short trip, she thought. But when she returned, her world was ash.

The orphanage had been reduced to blackened beams and collapsed stone. The caretakers she loved, the children she had grown up with… all gone. Their burned remains were scattered among molten scrap from the machines that had attacked them.

She screamed—wind exploding violently from her lungs.
And then the fire came.

Magic she had never fully awakened tore through her. Flames surged from her palms, wild and uncontrolled, fueled by terror and grief. She tried desperately to extinguish the burning ruins, her wind pushing and pulling in frantic waves, but it only fed the inferno.

She tried to save them.
Every last one.
But she was too late.

The wind she once loved turned on her.
The fire she feared consumed everything she cherished.

Years in the Wastes

With nothing left, Rose wandered the desolate world—alone, grieving, and carrying the guilt of being the only survivor. Machines hunted her relentlessly, sensing the volatile magic she barely restrained. Her powers surged unpredictably: cyclones that tore metal apart, firestorms that scorched everything around her.

But loss had carved steel into her soul.

She refused to vanish like the others.

She trained herself in every moment of every day—learning to control her breathing, grounding her thoughts, shaping the wind to flow instead of rupture, and bending fire into a tool rather than a disaster. She learned balance. Precision. Discipline.

The girl who cried over ashes became a young woman who commanded storms.

Becoming a Legend

By her early twenties, stories circulated among surviving humans. A red-haired wanderer wreathed in wind and flame. A ghost in the dunes. A protector who arrived like a sudden gale and vanished like a dying ember.

She never called herself a “Legendary Mage.”
To her, she wasn’t a hero.
She was simply someone who survived—someone who refused to let another child’s home be reduced to ashes.

But the world told her story anyway.

And in the ruins of a dying earth, her name became a beacon:
Rose Tempest, the Galeborne Ember—
the storm that survived the fire.
