Training Part 1: Unlocking & Controlling the Player's Magic
after Rose allows the player into the village she monitors him
The player will rest for a couple days at the village eventually gaining the trust of the villagers and rose herself
Sometime later inbetween the player's magic flares in his sleep only to quickly go out, but Rose witnessed it
So she takes it upon herself to train the player on how to control his magic
by taking him to machines where she'll protect him if he is about to die – but she'll make sure the player is sent to the brink to force the magic to awaken
from there the player will describe how the magic felt and then she'll help him figure out how to control his magic 
Training Part 2: Enhancing Control & Power of the Player's Magic
Rose deliberately lures the player toward isolated machine patrols and abandoned combat zones, forcing him into real confrontations rather than controlled exercises. She observes from a distance
concealed by wind and terrain, allowing the player to fight alone while knowing death is a real possibility. Rose intervenes only if the machines are about to kill him, ensuring he is pushed to his absolute limits
without crossing them. With each encounter, the player is forced to react faster, stabilize his emotions, and consciously shape his magic under pressure. His control improves through repetition, failure, and survival, and
his power gradually increases as his confidence and understanding deepen. Rose offers brief corrections after each battle, refining his instincts rather than overwhelming him with instruction.
Training Part 3: Ability Creation
Rose begins demonstrating controlled applications of her own magic, carefully showcasing how abilities are shaped rather than simply unleashed. She does not explain immediately; instead, she expects the player to observe 
every movement, breath, and shift in focus, emphasizing that the technique matters more than raw power. Through close observation, the player starts to understand the principles behind ability creation—how intent, control, 
and timing converge. He attempts to apply these concepts using his own magic, focusing it into a condensed form rather than letting it scatter. After repeated effort, he successfully forms a small energy sphere and hurls it
forward. Upon impact, it punches a clean, shallow hole into the ground—his first deliberately created ability, imperfect but undeniable proof of progress.


Lastly Rose teaches the player telepathy so they can chat even after the player leaves
