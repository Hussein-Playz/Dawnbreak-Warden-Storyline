Rose Tempest is a red-haired character
One of the 4 Legendary Mages
Her magics:
Wind + Fire
Wind can amplify Fire for her so her magics buff eachother
Location of finding:
15KM away from the lab where the player escapes
She confuses the player upon meeting as an enemy and easily captures him to interrogate him
The player doesn't fight back on the capture and answers every interrogation question truthfully - which is enough to let the player enter the village just being monitored by rose
