On the player’s final morning in Rose’s village, he rises before dawn, the quiet hum of the village stirring around him. He moves from house to house, bidding farewell to the villagers he has come to know and care for—people
who had shown him warmth, trust, and fleeting moments of peace in a world so harsh. Each goodbye carries a mix of gratitude and melancholy, but none as heavy as the one he is about to share with Rose. He finds her at the 
edge of the village, standing where the wind shifts and carries faint embers of the fires she controls. The player thanks her for everything—her patience, her guidance, and the rigorous training that transformed him from 
someone unsure of his magic into a fledgling mage capable of crafting his own abilities. Rose’s expression softens, and her voice trembles slightly as she responds, “Goodbye…” There is sadness there, but also pride. Over 
their time together, they had grown close; friends forged in the fires of hardship and the storms of survival.  Her gaze lingers on him, shadows of worry crossing her features. “I know I’ll see you again,” she says quietly, 
“but I can’t help being afraid. Out there… the path to the next mage is dangerous. You’ll face machines far deadlier than anything you’ve ever encountered.” She pauses, measuring her words carefully, then speaks with a 
mixture of authority and vulnerability: “You better not let me down. Succeed… but don’t die. Promise me that. Everyone is depending on you.” After a beat, she shifts her tone, giving him practical instructions. “I will 
inform [second legendary mage’s name] of your possible arrival in at least two weeks. Stay as safe as you can.” Rose traces a line across a worn map, indicating a vast section of land nearly a thousand kilometers wide, 
explaining that the village he seeks lies somewhere within it. “The journey is long—about three days of running, depending on what you encounter—but it is possible if you remain careful and alert.” With a final glance, 
Rose nods. “Remember everything we practiced. Trust your instincts, and trust your magic. You’ve come far… but the world out there will test you even more.” The player nods, understanding the weight of her words, and then 
turns to begin the journey that will take him toward the next legendary mage, carrying both her lessons and her trust with him.
