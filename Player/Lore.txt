The player is trained by a strict mentor figure who pushes him hard but ultimately cares for his survival. Her teaching style is harsh and disciplined, but her true intention is to help him unlock and control his own powers. She can only guide him in understanding his magic, since every mage’s abilities function uniquely. Even mages who use the same element cannot teach each other identical techniques, as their triggers, manifestations, and methods differ.

The player has only triggered his magic once before the story begins, so part of his journey involves discovering how to activate it again and eventually mastering something inherently unstable. Through her guidance, he begins developing his own fighting style and magical approach rather than inheriting anyone else’s abilities or spells.

The player is not weak; he is simply in the early stages of learning. Over time, he will possess three distinct magics, each becoming part of his evolution.

The Warden did not destroy the world—he took control of it. His rule resembles a centralized force dominating society, similar to how modern systems exert influence, but concentrated in a single, dangerous individual. His true backstory remains hidden until later in the narrative.

The player seeks the Warden because he is trying to recover his lost memories. He was once held in a laboratory created or overseen by the Warden, and his journey is driven by the desire to confront the person responsible. To uncover the truth, he interrogates machines left behind, extracting fragments of information that gradually reveal who the Warden is.
